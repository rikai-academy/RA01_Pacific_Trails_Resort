                <dt><b>What is a yurt?</b></dt>
                    <dd>Our luxury yurts are permanent structures four feet off
                        the ground. Each yurt is fully enclosed with canvas walls,
                        a wooden floor, and a roof dome that can be opened.

                <dt><b>How are the yurts furnished?</b></dt>
                    <dd>
                        Each yurt is furnished with a queen-size bed with down
                        quilt and gas-fired stove. Your luxury camping experience 
                        includes electricity and a sink with hot and cold running water.
                        Shower and restroom facilities are located in the lodge.

                        Most guests pack comfortable walking shoes and plan to dress for changing weather with light layers of clothing. 
                        It's also helpful to bring a flashlight and a sense of adventure!
